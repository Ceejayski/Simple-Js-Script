# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

## Your Breakdown Here
1. **Add custom id field for Agents**:

    - Acceptance Criteria:
      - Ability to add a custom id to each Agent in the Agents table.
      - The custom id should be unique within the Facility.
      - The custom id should be able to be edited or deleted.
    - Time/Effort Estimate: 2-3 hours
    - Implementation Details:
      - Create a custom id field in the Agents table.
      - Add validation to ensure uniqueness within the Facility.
      - Implement CRUD functionality for custom id.
    
2. **Use custom id in getShiftsByFacility**:

    - Acceptance Criteria:
      - The custom id should be used to identify the Agent in the list of Shifts returned by the getShiftsByFacility function.
      - The internal database id should still be stored in the database and used for any internal processes.
    - Time/Effort Estimate: 1-2 hours
    - Implementation Details:
      - Modify the getShiftsByFacility function to return the custom id for each Agent instead of their internal database id.
      - Ensure the internal database id is still stored in the database.
   
3. **Use custom id in generateReport**:

    - Acceptance Criteria:
      - The custom id should be used to identify the Agent on the report generated by the generateReport function.
      - The report should still show the total number of hours worked by each Agent.
    - Time/Effort Estimate: 1-2 hours
    - Implementation Details:
      - Modify the generateReport function to use the custom id to identify each Agent on the report.
      - Ensure the total number of hours worked by each Agent is still shown on the report.

4. **Test custom id functionality**:

    - Acceptance Criteria:
      - All custom id functionality is tested and working correctly.
      - No bugs or unexpected behavior is present.
    - Time/Effort Estimate: 2-3 hours
    - Implementation Details:
      - Test all custom id functionality, including adding a custom id, editing a custom id, and generating a report using the custom id.
      - Ensure that the internal database id is still used for internal processes and that the custom id is only used for reporting purposes.
